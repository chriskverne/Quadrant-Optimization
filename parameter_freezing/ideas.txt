Gradient approaches:
Average/EMA gradient over timestep
Oscilliation (compare sign of current gradient with previosu gradient)
Variance (compare gradients similarity over a period where more stable parameters are likely easier to train)

Additional approaches:
Importance based approaches (Identify parameter contributing the most to the loss function)

Quantum approaches:
Freeze parameters with values close to Prunable / Quantizable values
